                <p>
                    Anxiety is a feeling of fear, dread, and uneasiness that can be a normal reaction to stress. 
                    However, anxiety disorders are conditions where anxiety is excessive, doesn't go away, and can get worse over time. 
                    Anxiety disorders can interfere with daily activities, such as schoolwork, job performance, and relationships

                <p>
                    Depressive disorder (also known as depression) is a common mental disorder. 
                    It involves a depressed mood or loss of pleasure or interest in activities for long periods of time.

                <p>
                    Environmental stress refers to a negative subjective psychological response to an environmental stimulus. 
                    It is important to note that an environmental stimulus that is stressful for one person in a particular situation 
                    may not be stressful for another or for the same person in a different situation.
